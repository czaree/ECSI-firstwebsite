			<strong><h2>Minecraft</h2></strong>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Minecraft is an open sandbox game originally created by Marcus Pearsson,
				and more recently purchased by Microsoft. The game spawns you in a randomly generated world with little no instruction.
				The player is only bound by their own creativity.</p>
			<p>Minecraft holds a particulary special place in my heart. It was one of the first games I ever played, both with friends
			 and by myself. Life changed rapidly over that time, but the game kept drawing me back. My skills have only been improving since 2014.</p>
		 <p> My favorite part of the game was always just going into creative mode and making something cool, which can especially be seen in my most recent projects. For example:</p>
			<div class="minecraft">
				<div class="left">
					<img src="Other_Pictures/cherry_build_shot.png" alt="Japanese-inspired build" width="70%"; height="auto";>
			</div>
				<br>
				<strong><p>A recent build of mine.</p></strong>
			<div class="right">
					<img src="Other_Pictures/running_90s.png" alt="Screenshot of an in progress noteblock song" width="70%"; height="auto";>
			</div>
				<br>
				<strong><p style="text-align:right; padding-right:20px;">A work-in progress redition of the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ0xBCwkg3E" target="_blank" title="Running in the 90s - Original Song"><em>"Running in the 90s"</em></a>
					 that plays in game when a button is pressed.</p></strong>
