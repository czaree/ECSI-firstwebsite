			<strong><h2>Skyrim</h2></strong>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<p>The Elder Scrolls V, more commonly known as Skyrim, is a fantasy role playing games developed by Bethesda Softworks,
				and spearheaded by game director Todd Howard. Skyrim is one of those games that's imfamous for its bugs and glitches, which the developers prefer to
				 refer to as "features." As Todd Howard said, "It just works."</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, flying horses in Rorickstead or being launched into space by giants are
				 not compeling game features that enhance the user experience. However, it odes make for a good youtube video, which I used to watch hours of when I was much younger.
				  The game released in 2011, so I had a very long wait ahead of me before I was actually old enough to play it.</p>
		 	<p>I found the game's special edition for xbox on clearence about 2 years ago, and it's been nothing but a blast since. Every now
				and then it's fun to just run a new game and experience the whole journey again. The game's charm stems from its unrestricted freedom, but the bugs also add
				 quite a bit as well. The game breaks in just the right way that the resulting scene the player sees is hilarious. In no other game could you
				  bury a man in cheese, and then see someone swimming through the ground. The open world, character customization, and endless quests
					truly make each game unique. Even if it is a broken mess, Skyrim is still a detailed masterpiece of a game.</p>
