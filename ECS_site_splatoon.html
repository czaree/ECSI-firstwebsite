			<strong><h2>Splatoon</h2></strong>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<p>The Splatoon franchise is made up of games based around the wonderful wacky world of inklings and octolings. Developed by nintendo,
				 this third person shooter involves shooting ink to cover the most of the map you can. Cover enemies in ink to splat them,
				 and take their turf! The primary draw of the series is its multiplayer scene, which involves 4v4 turf war battles and many
				  other game modes. It also includes a single player campaign where the player defeats the Octarian Menace to help them get
					used to the game's controls. The second game even includes a challenging single player DLC, in which you must escape the
					 Deepsea Metro by completing up to 80 different levels.</p>
			<p>Splatoon is a charming franchise, which Unfortunately made its debut on a failing console. The Wii U didn't have a great selection
				 of games, but splatoon kept drawing me back to continue playing. I'd spend countless nights grinding multiplayer matches, just to unlock
				 new gear and weapons. The game's unique control scheme and concept worked together perfectly to create a shooter that is both fun and more age-appropriate.
				 Splatoon's migration to the Nintendo Switch through its sequel only improved the game's mechanics and graphics, making it a classic game that I still enjoy years later.</p>

				 <p>One of the new game modes introduced to the sequel, Splatoon 2, was a horde mode called Salmon Run. It's definitely one of the best features
					  of the game. Instead of the heavy emphasis on player vs player combat that the rest of the game posesses, Salmon run pits 4 players against
						 3 waves of creatures called salmonids. Many factors that the game randomizes, including weapon choice, maps, tide level, and special events, makes each round a blast. Between the 4 players, each must run
						 around the map and pick up enough eggs to meet the quota by defeating enemies.
						 Since I've never been the best at combat, the team-based mode appeals much more  to my strengths, as it requires solid planning and movement to survive and collect enough items to reach the objective.</p>
