			<strong><h2>About Me</h2></strong>

			<p>Hi, My name is Leah! I live in Massachusetts, and I'm currently a sophmore in highschool,
			 graduating in the class of 2023 <del>hopefully</del>. I've got two sisters, and sadly no pets currently.
			 I used to have a couple betta fish when I was much younger. My favorite color is green, and I like blueberries.</p>

			<h3>Coding</h3>
			<p>I've always had a huge interest in computer science and electronic adjacent topics. My dad works in a
				software realted position, and I've of course grown up online. Coding always seemed like magic to me, and once I started I just couldn't stop.
				 From scratch games, to simple html, and even a little bit of python, I've dabbled in it for years. Unlike language or the arts,
				 there was always logic behind the code, and making things work is like solving a massive puzzle. To me at least,
				 there's no better feeling then seeing something you've made come together.</p>
				 <p> This website is currently the latest project I've been working on. It's been a blast revisiting old concepts,
				  and even learning a lot of new things to make the best thing I possibly can. I'm suprised at how manyhours I've managed
					to put into this project as a whle, but I think its turned out pretty ok!
			 </p>

			<h3>Origami</h3>
			<p>Similarly to coding, I've been folding paper for a very long time. An old man in the public library taught me how to fold a crane
				 in the third grade, and I've been hooked ever since. I took things into my own hands, and probably used up 100s of sheets of
				 printer paper just practicing the same models over and over again. We must've had at least 50 tulips, swans, cranes, and other basic models
				 laying around the house for years. Over time I found that I was actually really good at making things, and started to look up tutorials
				 online and teach muself new things. Nowadays I mostly recycle the countless worksheets I get from school into huge geometric balls. They
				 make for a great centerpiece in the house, or even to hang on the ceiling.</p>
