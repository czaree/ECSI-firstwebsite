			<strong><h2>Foil Ball > Materials</h2></strong>

			<p>If you want to make your own foil ball, you can't just use any material! You've got to pick the
				 types that will help the ball stick together, especially when it gets bigger.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hershey's Kiss Wrappers - What I started out with. Excellent for
					getting started, but they don't stay on once the ball gets big enough.</li>
					<br>
				<li>Reece's Peanut Butter Cups - Slightly bigger then the Hershey's, so they can
					 be used for a bit longer. However, they also eventually start falling off.</li>
					 <br>
				<li>Tinfoil - Definietly works, its very big and can add a lot of bulk to the ball. However,
					I find it a lot more intersting and colorful to only use foil from non-convensional sources like candy wrappers.</li>
					<br>
				<li>Gum Wrappers - My best friend, gum wrappers have a sticky backside
					 if you can peel the paper backing off. They are pretty much essential
					  to keep the ball together at bigger sizes. As a bonus, it also gives the ball a nice shiny coat. (Note: only some brands
						are easy to use. I mostly take Extra and 5 Gum, some, like Trident Gum, are unreasonably hard to remove.)</li>
						<br>
				<li>Lindor Chocolates - These round balls' wrappers are made up of foil with a plastic cover. If
					you can peel the platic backing off, they act similarly to gum wrappers. Weirdly though, only some types of Lindors peel
					 easily. After experimenting it seems at least like the red ones don't work quite as well.</li>
					 <br>
				<li>Andes Mints - Similarly to gum wrappers, if the paper can be peeled off of the back of
					these they'll be sticky and help hold the ball together. They are a little bit harder to find, and
					 are also slightly harder to peel, but if you've got them on hand they'll work well enough.</li>
