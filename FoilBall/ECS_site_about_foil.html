			<h2>How it started</h2>
			<p>The Ball's humble beginnings start over Christmas Break long long ago.
				One of the gifts I recieved was a large bag of Hershey's Kisses. Of course, I immediatly
				ate a large portion of the bag, but didn't feel like throwing away all of the wrappers,
				so I balled them up and shoved it back in the bag. When I finished the bag of chocolates, the foil ball stayed.
				I put it on my desk for another time.</p>
		 	<p>Come February, I recieved another, smaller, giift of chocolate. Instead of throwing away the wrappers,
			 	my curiosity got the better of me. I started putting them on the ball again. AFter that, I realized that useable
				aluminum foil was in many everyday products, and was all potential material to add onto my collection. Provided
				I could get any sort of paper or adhesive off of the foil that is. I started to really look for things I could use to make the ball bigger.</p>
			<p>This continued on for a while, I started keeping wrappers of all kinds and stealing aluminum
			 foil that was about to be tossed out. Constantly wrapping the ball with more foil and then rolling
			 it around on a smooth surface eventually created the shiny mass of metal I have today. Currently, it's about the size of a baseball, and
			 pretty much solid to the core.</p>
